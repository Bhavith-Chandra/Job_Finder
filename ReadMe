Job Finder
Description
Job Finder is a Python script that allows you to search for jobs easily. You just need to input the type of job you are searching for and mention the skills you are not familiar with. The script then creates a directory containing all the details of the companies related to your preferences. The information is scraped from the website Indeed.com.
